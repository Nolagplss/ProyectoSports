# 🏋️‍♂️ SportsCenter API

This is a backend project in development for managing reservations in a sports facility. The API is built with **ASP.NET Core** following clean architecture principles (Controllers → Services → Repositories), and implements **JWT authentication**, role and permission control, and a fully functional facility reservation system.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** This project is still under development. Key features yet to be completed include:
> - Advanced validation
> - Automated testing
> - Docker support
> - Cloud deployment (AWS planned)  
> Still, the app is **functional**.
